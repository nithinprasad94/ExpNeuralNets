# ExpNeuralNets

# Imported a simple neural net in Python from http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/ and 
# attempted to understand its intricacies, by breaking it up into its sub-components and printing results.
# Varied parameter values to see the differing results, and will look to understand it better in the future.
